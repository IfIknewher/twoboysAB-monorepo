Here is your full transport package, wrapped and ready:

Download: truthproject_repo_package.zip

Contents

app/ → orchestrator entry (main.py)

blocks/ → block scripts (001, 011, 021, 031, 040, 046)

schemas/ → JSON registry of blocks

infra/ → Bicep/infra placeholders

.github/workflows/ → ci.yml, deploy.yml, chatops.yml

tests/ → pytest stub

Dockerfile, requirements.txt, README.md

scripts/push-https.ps1 → helper for first push with a Personal Access Token

How to use

Unzip to C:\Users\justo\src\truthproject (or any folder).

Generate a fine-grained PAT with repo truthproject and scopes:

Contents: Read/Write

Metadata: Read

Workflows: Read/Write

In PowerShell inside the folder:

./scripts/push-https.ps1 -Token YOUR_TOKEN


Go to GitHub → repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Secrets: AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

Variables: ACR_LOGIN_SERVER, ACR_NAME, AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP, AZURE_APP_NAME

After push, Actions will auto-run (ci then deploy). You can trigger with /deploy, /status in issues/PRs.

Would you like me to extend this package with the extra workflows (nightly drift, ACR cleanup, post-deploy health, release-drafter) as well, so you have the full automation set from the start?

yes please

Use:

Unzip into C:\Users\justo\src\truthproject.

Push as before (PAT or SSH).

Add Actions secrets and variables.

Open an issue and comment /deploy then /status
